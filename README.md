# Project: E-Card for Mr. T

## **[Start Contribution Now](#repo-setup)**

## Contribution
Hey y'all! We made it. Also, wanted to say thanks you to each one of ya for being you & coding!

Now onto this e-card app. This is the best way for us all to make a thank you card & send appreciation for the man, the myth, the legend: `Thomas W. Smith`. In return, we can have a chance to demonstrate our newly found skills as Full-Stack Developers!

For this e-card app, the goal is to have us ~20 students (all) contribute to this GitHub repository & create your react component. Then finally, get it deployed. If/Once I get all of ya to get the MVP done, then it will be time to show Thomas this gift. From all of us to him. Yeeet! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

2. **demo the app**
    - click the search button
    - click on `michael alvarez`
    - press enter
    - done.

## Create Student Component Setup
1. **go to `./src/students.json`**
    - add your name to the `student.json` file
    - **COPY:** `{ "name" : "<your name>" }`
2. **go to `./public/assets/images/other/`**
    - add your profile image here
        - `/other/<your-profile.img>`
    - (optional) rename image file to your first & last name
    - (tip) to use the image into your component
        - `<img src="./assets/images/other/<your-profile.img>" alt="student-profile" />`
3. **go to `./src/views/StudentPage/`**
    - copy & paste `--COPY-PASTE-RENAME` from & to `/StudentPage/`
    - rename folder & file to your first & last name    
        - `/StudentPage/FirstNameLastName/` & `FirstNameLastName.css FirstNameLastName.js`

    - open `<YourName>.js`, then replace `FirstNameLastName` with your first & last name
        - e.g: `import './MichaelAlvarez.css'` & `export default function MichaelAlvarez () {}`
4. **go to `./src/index.js`**
    - import & route your component
        - proper syntax setup
            - component === YourName
            - route path === your-name
    - replace `first-name-last-name` / `FirstNameLastName` with your first & last name
        - **COPY:** `import FirstNameLastName from './views/StudentPage/FirstNameLastName/FirstNameLastName';`

- add any additional stuff onto your component
    - personal/bonus feature
    - styling/interacting
    - random easter egg?

```jsx
(
<main>
  <h2>First & Last Name</h2>
  <img 
    src="./assets/images/other/< your-profile.img >"
    alt="student-portfolio"
  />
  <p>
    - a memorable/funny moment with Thomas & the class
    - additional message for Thomas (feedback/question)
  </p>
  <div>
    <a 
      href="/" 
      target="_blank" 
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      title=""
    >
      links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.

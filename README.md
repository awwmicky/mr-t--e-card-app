# Project: E-Card for Mr. T

## Contribution
Hey y'all! We made it. Also, wanted to say thanks you to each one of ya for being you & coding!

Now onto this e-card app. This is the best way for us all to make a thank you card for the man, the myth, the legend: `Thomas W. Smith`. In return, we can have a chance to demonstrate our newly found skills as Full-Stack Developers!

For this e-card app, the goal is the have all 20~ students contribute to this GitHub repository & create your react component. Finally, get it deployed. If/Once I get all of ya to get the MVP done, then it will be time to show Thomas this gift. From all of us to him. Yeeet! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## Q & A

    - once you got the invite, read the doc.
    - also, `git clone` this repository

    - or ask me any questions, maybe
